   - Coverage for vulnerability types not addressed by static analysis
   - Implementation in `loophole_detection.py`:
     ```python
     def detect_custom_patterns(ast_data):
         findings = []
         # Example pattern detection
         for node in ast_nodes:
             if matches_pattern(node, REENTRANCY_PATTERN):
                 findings.append(create_finding("reentrancy", node))

         return findings
     ```

3. **Machine Learning Layer**:
   - Trained models for vulnerability classification
   - Feature-based detection of subtle vulnerability patterns
   - Anomaly detection for unusual code patterns

     ```python
     def apply_ml_detection(features, model):
         prediction = model.predict(features)
         confidence = model.predict_proba(features)
         if prediction[0] == 1:
             return create_ml_finding(confidence)
         return None
     ```

4. **Hybrid Analysis Layer**:
   - Correlation of results across detection layers
   - Verification of static analysis findings with ML confirmation
   - Resolution of conflicting detection results

     ```python
     def consolidate_findings(static_findings, pattern_findings, ml_findings):
         consolidated = {}
         # Merge findings from different detection methods
         for finding in all_findings:
             if finding.id in consolidated:
                 consolidated[finding.id].boost_confidence()
                 consolidated[finding.id].add_source(finding.source)
             else:
                 consolidated[finding.id] = finding
