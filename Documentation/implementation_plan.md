   - Comprehensive testing of file dependency resolution with edge cases

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for delivering the high-priority features for the Smart Contract Analyzer. The total estimated development time is approximately 6 weeks, with potential for parallel development to accelerate delivery. Regular progress reviews and adjustments to the plan are recommended as development proceeds.
